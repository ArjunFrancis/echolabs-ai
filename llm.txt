## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-12)
- Core evaluation engine (LLM API integration, test execution, scoring)
- Agent monitoring UI (real-time status, metrics, logs)
- User authentication and multi-tenancy
- Basic compliance dashboard

### Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Weeks 13-24)
- Advanced compliance testing (bias, privacy, safety)
- Multimodal evaluation (vision, audio)
- Dataset management and versioning
- RLHF pipeline

### Phase 3: Automation & Scale (Weeks 25-36)
- Marketing automation agents (lead scoring, outreach)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Partner program portal
- API rate limiting and quotas

---

## Key Constraints & Requirements

## Common Patterns & Conventions

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case: `ai-readiness-audit-framework.md`
- Be descriptive: `multimodal-testing-architecture.md` not `testing.md`

### Git Commits
- Format: `Area: Description`
- Examples: `Repo QA: README uplift`, `Platform: Add eval engine spec`

### Code Style
- **Python:** Black formatter, type hints, docstrings
- **TypeScript:** ESLint, Prettier, strict mode
- **API:** RESTful naming, versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/`)
